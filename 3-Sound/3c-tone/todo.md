## To Do ##

1. Modify the sample code so that each note lasts twice as long.  What delay
times between notes do you need to ensure that you can hear both notes distinctly?

2. Modify the frequency with which `makeSound()` is called until the sound
it makes matches the sound make by the `tone()` function.
