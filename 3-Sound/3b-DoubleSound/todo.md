## To Do ##

1.  Convince yourself that this circuit and accompanying code really
do double the power through the buzzer by moving one of the leads of
the buzzer to the `GND` bus of the breadboard.  (You will also need to
connect one of the `GND` pins of the Arduino to the `GND` bus, so both
the Arduino and the breadboard are using the same ground.)
