## Controlling Arduinos with Sensors ##

All of the packets in this section will be about using various devices 
as *inputs* to an Arduino, in order to control one or more output devices.

* Packet 1 on [switches](6a-switches) illustrates the use of a pushbutton for
turning a device on or off.

* Packet 2 on [pots](6b-potentiometers) shows how to use a potentiometer to control 
the position of a servo motor.

* Packet 3 on using a [PIR (passive InfraRed](6c-proximity-sensor) proximity sensor
shows how to turn on and LED when motion is detectted.
