1. Add an external LED to your circuit and your sketch.
Re-write `init()` so that it starts out with both 
the external and on-board LED turned off.  Then re-write `loop()`
so that it alternately turns on the two LEDs:

    * Turn on the external LED for just 1 second, then 
    * Turn on the on-board LED for 1 second

2. Modify your sketch to create a more complicated pattern between the external
and on-board LED.  For example, modify `loop()` to:

    * Turn on the external LED for just 1 second, then 
    * Turn on the on-board LED for 1 second
    * Turn on both LEDs for 1 second
    * Wait for 2 seconds
