This project uses only:

* an Arduino board that supports a serial port connection and
* a computer (or some device that can output the values produced by the Arduino).

Note that not all boards that can be programmed with Arduino software 
are capable of using its Serial Console.  Among these are the Adafruit "Trinket", 
where both board size and cost were reduced by eliminating the Serial Port.

The "circuit" is the same as that used for the project to [blink the on-board LED](../../1-LED/1a-OnBoardLED/circuit.html).
