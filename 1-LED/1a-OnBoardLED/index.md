## Blink the On-Board LED ##

Almost every microcontroller board comes equipped with at least one built-in LED.  
That LED can be controlled by setting the voltage of its corresponding I/O pin:

* Set the voltage `HIGH` to turn the LED on
* Set the voltage `LOW` to turn the LED off

The I/O pin that controls the onboard LED is different for different microcontroller
boards.  This packet illustrates two different microcontroller boards which use
different I/O pins to control their on-board LED.

The sample code (aka "sketch") in this packet will cause
the on-board LED to turn on for 1 second, then turn off for 1 second; this
will repeat indefinitely.

Once you have completed the exercises in this packet, you will know:

* how to write a simple program
* how to check and compile the sketch 
* how to download your sketch to your microcontroller board

This packet's "todo" page suggest some interesting ways in which you can modify the 
original blink sketch to shorten (or lengthen) the "on" time or "off" time, and
to create a more complicated blink pattern.
