1. Change the length of the time that the LED is ON.  You can make the LED 
look like a strobe light by making the "ON" time very, very short.

2. Change the length of time that the LED is OFF.  You will find out there is
a shortest time (probably greater than 10 ms) below which you can't see that 
the LED is turned off or not.

3. Change the pattern.  Tell the LED to make 3 short blinks, followed by a 
relatively long delay.

4. Change the pattern again.  Tell the LED to make 3 short blinks, followed by 
three long blinks, followed by three short blinks, followed again by a rather
long delay.  Congratulations!  You have just made the LED blink out the 
equivalent of "SOS"!

5. Re-write the sample sketch so that it turns on the LED one time, delays
for 1 second, and then turns it off *until the board is reset*.
