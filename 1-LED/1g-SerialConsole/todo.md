## To Do ##

1.  Modify the sketch that prints out square roots so that instead of printing
out the square root (`sqrt(num)`) of each number, it prints the square 
of the number (`num * num`).

2.  Modify the sketch again so that the squares are all lined up on the 
right-hand side (i.e., "right justified").  

3.  Prompt the user to input three integers.  Then sum the result and output 
the answer on the Serial Console.

4.  In the sketch that asks you how many blinks you want, add a new 
`while` condition that also asks you how long you want each blink to last.
Then modify the `blink` function so that it takes one argument, and blinks
the LED for the specified number of seconds.
