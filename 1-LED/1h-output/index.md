## How to See Program-Generated Output ##

This packet shows how to display values (specifically, a table of square roots)
using the Arduino Serial Console on the Arduino.

The packet shows how to display several types of values:

* a string
* an integer number
* a floating point number

and also shows how to require that the output should end a line (so that any
further output must start out on a new line).

No interaction with the user is required.

As you look at the output from the sketch in this packet, keep in
mind that the results were calculated by the microprocessor on the
Arduino.
