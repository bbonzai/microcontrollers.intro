## To Do ##

1. Add the on-board LED (pin 13 on an Arduino UNO) to your sketch. 
Re-write the `setup()` function in your sketch so that it starts out with 
both the external and on-board LED turned off.  Then re-write 
`loop()` so that it alternately turns on the two LEDs:

    * Turn on the external LED for just 1 second, then 
    * Turn on the on-board LED for 1 second

2. Modify your sketch to create a more complicated pattern between the external
and on-board LED.  For example, modify `loop()` to:

    * Turn on the external LED for just 1 second, then 
    * Turn on the on-board LED for 1 second
    * Turn on both LEDs for 1 second
    * Wait for 2 seconds
