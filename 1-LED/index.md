## Simple Arduino Circuits ##

* Packet [1a-OnBoardLED](1a-OnBoardLED) shows how to blink the LED that comes
on every Arduino controller board.  This packet also illustrates the general
structure of any `arduino` program, and shows how to upload the program 
to your board.

* Packet [1b-ExternalLED](1b-ExternalLED) shows how to use a breadboard,
set up a simple circuit using the digital I/O pins on the Arduino, and
control an external device.

* Packet [1c-SeveralLEDs](1c-SeveralLEDs) expands on Packet 1b-ExternalLED,
showing you how to simulate a traffic stoplight using three different LEDs.

## Key Programming Skills ##

* Packet [1d-Functions](1d-Functions) shows how to streamline your code
by taking blocks of repeated statements and placing them into your own
custom-designed function.  This will make your code more readable, easier
to test and easier to re-use.

* Packet [1e-conditionals](1e-conditionals) shows how to get greater control
over an `arduino` program by executing selected statements only if/when some
logical test is satisfied.  This is a basic component of programming in any language.

* Packet [1f-loops](1f-loops) shows how to repeat a sequence of steps 
a certain number of times, or until some condition is met.

## Interacting with the Arduino ##

* Packet [1g-SerialConsole](1g-SerialConsole) shows how to read data from your 
Arduino while its working, and how to control the behaviour of a program from
your keyboard.
