## Circuit for Displaying Keyboard Input ##

The circuit needed for this packet is just an Arduino board.  

But note!  Not just *any* Arduino board will do!  Some Arduino boards
do not have a fully functional USB port, and therefore can only be
used for Serial input and output.  Among these are the Adafruit Trinket, which 
uses a less powerful microcontroller (an ATMega 32u4) than the one on the 
Arduino UNO (an ATMega 328).
