1.  Modify the code so that the lights all blink at the same time.

2.  Modify the code so that it has the "walk-pattern" used in Massachusetts (and in Sweden):

> * Red goes on, then
> * Red and yellow go on (signalling it's OK to walk) , then
> * Green goes on, then
> * Yellow goes on

<!--
3.  Modify the circuit to add 2 more LEDs.  Then write a sketch that:

>  * turns on just 2 of the LEDs at once, then
>  * tries to turn on all 5 LEDs at once for about 1 s (no longer), then
>  * gives the poor, weary Arduino a well-deserved 3s pause

>  Are the LEDs as bright when they are all turned on?
