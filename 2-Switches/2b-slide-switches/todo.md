## To Do ##

1.  Modify the code so that the switch has the effect of changing not just the
durations, but the lighting pattern.  For example,

When the switch is on one side, 
: both lights turn on for a certain amount of time (say, 500 msec), and 
: then both turn off for a certain amount of time.

When the switch is on the other side,
: one light is `ON`, while the other one is `OFF`, and then
: the first light is `OFF` while the other is `ON`.

2.  With the addition of just one more LED (a green one), you'll have the makings
of a real traffic light.  Adjust the code so that 

* When the switch is on one side, the traffic light behaves normally, i.e. only red on, 
then only yellow on, then only green on.

* When the switch is on the other side, the green light is never on, and both the
red light and the yellow light flash `ON` then `OFF`.
