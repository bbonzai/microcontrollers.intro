## Switches ##

In the [first series of packets](../1-LED), the code in each example was used as
a "switch" to turn LEDs on and off.

This series of packets introduces many more types of switches.
Wikipedia has a great summary of the nomenclature and various forms of 
[physical switches](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch).
What unites all switches is that they redirect flow.  In the case of a 
physical switch, the flow being redirected is (usually) electrical current.  
In the case of a logical switch, the flow of the program itself is 
redirected to a different statement or block of statements.

Packet [2a-if-then](2a-if-else) 
: introduces the programming construct: `if-else`,
: which allows you to redirect your program to different branches depending on what
: you are trying to accomplish.
 
Packet [2b-slide-switches](2-slide-switches) 
: introduces slide switches, which you can use to activate or de-activate
: some statement or block of your code by pushing the handle from one side
: to the other.

Packet [2c-pushbutton](2-pushbutton) 
: introduces pushbutton switches. 

All of the packets in this section used simple LEDs.
