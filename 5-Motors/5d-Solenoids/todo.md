## To Do ##

1.  Change the pattern of `HIGH`/`LOW` signals to the solenoid, so that instead of being 
on (`HIGH`) for 1.5s, and off (`LOW`) for 4s, it is on and then off in some other sequence,
e.g.:  3 short on/off-cycles, followed by a long delay, followed by 1 long on/off cycle.

> > Be sure to use [a `for` loop](../../1-LED/1f-loops) to keep your code simple.
