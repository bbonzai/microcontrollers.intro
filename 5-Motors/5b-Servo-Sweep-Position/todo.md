## To Do ##

These are some suggestions to test how well your motor can sweep from side to side without
stopping at the edges (too much).  To do this, tape some long, lightweight device to
the arm of your servo, e.g., a straw.  Place two obstacles to the straw's motion, one
on either side.

1.  Write a program that makes the servo sweep from one side to the opposite, delay 1 second, and
    then sweep back.  Then, keeping the obstacles in place, modify the program so that the
    delay is half as much.  Can the servo keep up?  Keep doing this till you find the delay
    time where the servo cannot keep up with changes in direction.
