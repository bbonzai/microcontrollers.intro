## To Do ##

1.  Revise the example code so that the servo moves through the discrete positions:
0°, 10°, 20°, etc.  

2.  Revise the example code to experiment with the delay time and see how short 
you can make it before the servo starts mis-behaving.

3.  Revise the example code so that the on-board LED blinks for a short time 
   (say, 20 msec) when the servo reaches its extreme clockwise position.
