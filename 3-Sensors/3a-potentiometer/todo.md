## To Do ##

1.  Modify the code so that it prints the blink time ranges from 50ms to 1000ms 
rather than 50ms to 500ms.

2.  Modify the code so that it prints the blink time on the Serial Console
just before it calls the `blink` function; modify the code again so that it
prints the analog input value and the blink time on every line.

3.  Add a second (green) LED to the ciruit, and modify the code so that when the 
analog input reading is 0 through 512, it causes the red LED to light up and
change blink time, but at values higher than 512, the red LED is turned off,
and the LED is off.
