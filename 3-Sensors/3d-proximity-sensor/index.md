## Passive Infrared (PIR) Sensors ##

A PIR (aka Passive InfraRed) Sensor detects motion when some warm object (like a 
person or a mouse or a falling soldering iron) moves within its field of view.
When it detects motion, it sets its digital output line `HIGH`.

PIR sensors are commonly used:

* in robotics, to sense an obstacle in the path (and thereby alert the robot that
it needs to change direction), 

* in security applications, where a motion implies the presence of some unexpected
or unwanted activity.

PIR sensors are no replacement for actual security cameras; they certainly can't tell
who is present in a secure area.  However, they are an inexpensive tool for 
monitoring areas of interest.
