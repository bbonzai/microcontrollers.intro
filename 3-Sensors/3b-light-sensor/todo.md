## To Do ##

1.  The CdS can be used to control the *blink rate* of an LED in the same
way as the [pot was used](../3a-potentiometer/code.html).  Check it out!

2.  Try different CdS sensors and see what variation in maximum and
minimum readings you get.  Try using two CdS sensors in the same circuit
(one on analog pin `A0` and one on analog pin `A1`, and use the Serial Console
to see how much their readings differ.
