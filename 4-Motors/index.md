## Controlling Motors with an Arduino ##

Motors are at the heart of robotics.  Most robots have a few motors, some have
dozens of motors.  The selection and effective use of motors is obviously a
central issue in designing and building robots that do what you want.

One way to distinguish the many types of motors is by the mechanism used to 
control them.  The table below provides some rough categorization of motors,
according to what they control:

| Type of Motor                | What Can Be Controlled      | How It Is Controlled                 |
|:-----------------------------|:----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Simple ("toy") DC motor      | Speed                       | Vary the Voltage                     |
| Servo motors, esp. RC motors | Position (from 0째 to 180째)  | Pulse Width                          |
| Industrial servo motors      | Position AND speed control  | Customized circuitry                 |
| Stepper Motors               | Position (from 0째 to >360째) | Sequence of Discrete HIGH/LOW Signals|

The packets in this section focus only on hobbiest (RC) servo motors, since they
are the simplest type to interface to an Arduino.
